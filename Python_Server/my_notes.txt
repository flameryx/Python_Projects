Improvements on my Programm:

+ If there is a folder with the same name in server and client, download and upload should transfer the file to that folder.

+ Server says what file is being downloaded or uploaded

+ Make the client work with a custom file system in another computer.

+ Clean the code and create more functions

+ Write message: "Are you sure you want to change to (server/client)_database? Y/N"

+ "EXIT" command should finish the connection of the client, dont matter in what file system it is.

+ "DOWNLOAD" and "UPLOAD" are used to change between file systems. Maybe add another command for that?
