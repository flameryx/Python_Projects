Improvements on my Programm:

+ If there is a folder with the same name in server and client, download and upload should transfer the file to that folder.

+ Make the client work with a custom file system in another computer.

+ Write message: "Are you sure you want to change to (server/client)_database? Y/N"

+ "EXIT" command should finish the connection of the client, dont matter in what file system it is.

+ To change file system
